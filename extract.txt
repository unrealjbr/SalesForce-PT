The ‘$getItems’ method in this specific controller is only one example of a built-in method that can be used to extract total information from an object, there are plenty however this is the one I typically use. In this payload I’m using pretty much the minimum required parameters for it to work. The full definition for this method and others will be provided at the end of the article. Here’s a little overview of the important parameters:

    entityNameOrId - Object name

    getCount - if set to ‘true’, will return the number of records returned

    pageSize - The larger the number, the greater potential number of records returned. Capped at 1000.

    currentPage - If you’ve capped the pageSize but there are more records, incrementing the currentPage value will return the records for the next page

Once you’re happy with these values, ensure that the ‘MARKER’ string is surrounded by the intruder markers.
