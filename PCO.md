# Pull Custom Objects

Replace the ‘message’ parameter value with the following in order to pull custom objects accessible by a Guest user:
```
the order is in the objs.txt file.
```
This will return a list of objects within the ‘apiNamesToKeyPrefixes’ key. Search for ‘__c’ within the response and copy any objects suffixed by this, as we know that these are custom.
